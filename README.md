These contain mainly compiled code for me to import into the squarespace website via [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

## Important links

Sometimes you can reference the `main` branch, but it's best not to do so because an accidental commit can mess things up. Thus, it is better to refer to a specific commit, especially when the product/component is stable.
