These contain mainly compiled code for me to import into the squarespace website via [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

## Important links

Sometimes you can reference the `main` branch, but it's best not to do so because an accidental commit can mess things up. Thus, it is better to refer to a specific commit/tag, especially when the product/component is stable. For example, after the Navigation bar was stable, I released it under version 1.0.

Maybe it might be better to also put the source code into Squarespace? Lol idk.

### Navigations

June 27 - Main Navigation and Sidecar Nav is finished (fully replicates the original)
